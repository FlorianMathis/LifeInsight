# LifeInsight
We present LifeInsight, an AI-powered assistive wearable equipped with an on-body camera, microphone, and a
single-click interface for goal-oriented visual querying for blind and low vision (BLV) people. We evaluated LifeInsight across six
scenarios, identified through multiple week-long video-based cultural probes with BLV people.

Experimental template code for additional testing.

## Hardware Used
LifeInsight consists of a mixture of off-the-shelf hardware, with additional 3D printing for the camera mount and the button. As computing device we used a Raspberry Pi 4.
