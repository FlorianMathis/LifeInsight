# LifeInsight
We present LifeInsight, an AI-powered assistive wearable equipped with an on-body camera, microphone, and a
single-click interface for goal-oriented visual querying for blind and low vision (BLV) people. We evaluated LifeInsight across six
scenarios, identified through multiple week-long video-based cultural probes with BLV people.
